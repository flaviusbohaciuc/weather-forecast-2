## About the project

The weather forecast app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes sass, redux and styled components.

The app is showing the current weather and the next 5 days at the same hour as the current one [this can be changed in a future update].

The sun is a static css animation, where the clouds and the windmill are css animations powered by the wind speed from current weather.

The project will aim to future a day-night cycle and using weather data to change the appearance of the app.
